# Todo Console App

This is a a simple console app I used as a learning opportunity to implement the basics of object oriented programming with C#.

The app allows a user to create and manage todo lists with basic operations such as adding, listing, deleting, and marking tasks as completed.

# Notes / Future Improvements

- Add unique IDs for each todo to simplify deletion and editing

- Refactor menus to be data-driven rather than hard-coded switch statements

- Add persistence (save/load todos to a file or database)
